# SVG-Logo-Generator ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)


## Description
My motivation in building this program was to expand the capability and functionality of my code by using the concepts of constructors and classes which allow for better code and reusibility. I built this program for the purpose of creating an SVG logo from the given responses of a user,as well as making my code more useful and versitle and applicable.This problem solves the problem of having a program that creates a logo based on your desired prefernce,ranging from the type of shape and color. I learned to think of my code in terms of common use and what could be used as a common frame for reuse in the future in this case the implementation of constructors and classes.
